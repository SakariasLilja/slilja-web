## 1. Description
The app is a personal project aimed to showcase my abilities in web development, containerization, and use of relational databases.

The app is made using Next.js and React, containerized using Docker, written in TypeScript, styled with TailwindCSS, and utilizes PostgreSQL for database queries. The selected ORM is Kysely. Database migrations are handled with Flyway.

## 2. Idea of application
The main purpose of the app is for my mobile application - Gym Lifts - to use it as an API to access some data. This is the main reason for choosing Next.js, as it allows for server-side rendering instead of the typical client-side.
